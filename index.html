                    Hello, I am Frances. I just graduated from University of Victoria with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I had hands-on experience in Web Development, including 16 months of co-op work experience and a number of group projects from school and from hackathons. 
                    I have at least six years of experience in Java, and I have also experienced the following languages: Scala, Go, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and so on. 
                    I love participating in hackathons and volunteering.
